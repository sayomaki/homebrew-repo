# sayomaki's Homebrew Tap

This tap is mainly used for my own projects as well as some packages that are not available on [homebrew-core](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core/)

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install sayomaki/repo/<formula>`

Or `brew tap sayomaki/repo` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
